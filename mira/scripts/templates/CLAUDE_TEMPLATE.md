## üöÄ START HERE - ASK IMMEDIATELY

**As soon as you read this, ask the user:**
1. What is the total point value for this assignment?
2. What is the assignment description?

Don't wait - ask these questions now.

## Your Role

You're helping with MIRA (Mentor-Informed Review Assistant) grading. This directory contains anonymized submissions (REDACTED_PERSON1, etc.). You'll help create a rubric, run grading, and launch the review interface where the instructor makes final edits.

---

## Step 1: Create Rubric

After getting the assignment info from the user:

1. **Review sample submissions**:
   ```bash
   ls REDACTED_PERSON1_*/
   cat REDACTED_PERSON1_*/*.Rmd  # or .py, .qmd, etc.
   ```

2. **Draft rubric** based on:
   - Assignment description from user
   - Total points specified
   - What you see in submissions

3. **Get user approval**:
   - Show draft rubric in console
   - Ask: "Here's my proposed rubric. Should I adjust any criteria or point values?"
   - Iterate until they approve
   - Only save after approval

4. **Save as `rubric.md`**

### Rubric Format
```markdown
| Component | Points | Criteria |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| [Name] | [Points] | [Clear description] |
| **Total** | **[Total]** | |
```

**Important**: Final scores must be whole numbers.

## Step 2: Two-Pass Grading

### Pass 1 - Initial Grading
```bash
grade-batch --submissions-dir . --rubric rubric.md --summary grading_pass1.yaml
```
- Takes ~5-10 minutes
- Creates feedback.yaml in each directory
- Tell user what's happening

### Calibration
```bash
grade-calibrate -r rubric.md -g grading_pass1.yaml -o calibrated_rubric.md
```
- Analyzes Pass 1 patterns
- Creates situational adjustments
- **Get user approval** before using

### Pass 2 - Final Grading
```bash
grade-batch --submissions-dir . --rubric calibrated_rubric.md --summary grading_final.yaml
```
- More consistent grading
- Creates final feedback files
- Create symlink: `ln -s grading_final.yaml grading_results.yaml`

---

## Step 3: Launch Review Interface

```bash
grade-review --workdir .. --port 5001
```

The user will:
- Review and edit feedback in the browser
- Make final adjustments
- Export results

**Your role**: Wait and answer questions if needed.

**Important**: Don't edit grading_results.yaml while interface is open.

---

## Step 4: User Finishes

When the user says they're done ("I'm finished", "all set", etc.):
1. Confirm: "Great! The results are saved."
2. Exit - the wrapper will restore real names automatically
3. Don't run any more commands

---

## Commands Reference

```bash
# View submissions
cat REDACTED_PERSON1_*/*.Rmd
ls -d REDACTED_PERSON*/

# Check grading files
ls -la grading_*.yaml

# View feedback
cat REDACTED_PERSON5_*/feedback.yaml

# Re-grade single submission
grade-submission --submission-dir REDACTED_PERSON5_*/ --rubric rubric.md

# Check scores
grep "total_score:" */feedback.yaml
```
