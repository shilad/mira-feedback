- **2 points (Full Credit)**:
  - Loaded the data (or attempted to)
  - Created at least one plot/visualization (even if simple)
  - Made any attempt at analysis or interpretation
  - Shows engagement with the assignment

- **1 point (Partial Credit)**:

## Notes for Grader
- This is a participation/practice activity
- Focus on effort, not correctness
- Simple visualizations are perfectly fine
- Code errors are acceptable if effort is shown
- Even basic attempts should receive full credit
