# Analysis of Sorting Algorithms

## Introduction
This report analyzes the time complexity of various sorting algorithms.

## Algorithms Analyzed
1. Bubble Sort - O(nÂ²)
2. Quick Sort - O(n log n) average case
3. Merge Sort - O(n log n)
4. Heap Sort - O(n log n)

## Methodology
Each algorithm was tested on arrays of different sizes ranging from 100 to 10,000 elements.

## Results
Quick Sort showed the best average performance for random data.
Merge Sort was most consistent across different input patterns.

## Conclusion
The choice of sorting algorithm depends on the specific use case and data characteristics.
